# World Ape CoinFlip üé≤üêµ

## World Ape CoinFlip is an interactive coin flip game where users can bet using their ORO tokens. The game currently supports ORO, with future support for WORLD and ORB tokens in the pipeline. Built on the Worldcoin MiniKit React Template, it consists of three primary components:

1. Frontend: The user interface for players to interact with the game.
2. Backend: Handles the API interactions.
3. Contract: Manages the game's mechanics, including coinflip and token payouts.

## Deployment Instructions
### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
